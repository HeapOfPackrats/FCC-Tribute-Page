            <ul>
                <li>During Israel's stay in ancient Egypt, Pharoah, fearing the growing population of Israelites in Egypt, enslaved the Israelites.</li>
                <li>Moses, whose name means "drawn forth", was born during Israel's enslavement. During Moses's infancy, Pharoah ordered the death of Israel's male children.</li>
                <li>Moses's mother, in order to save Moses, placed him in a basket and hid him in the reeds of the Nile.</li>
                <li>Moses was found and adopted by Pharoah's daughter. Moses's sister Miriam, who coincidentally served Pharoah's daughter, arranged for Moses to be raised by her (and Moses's) mother.</li>
                <li>Moses grew up in Pharaoh's court and lived as Egyptian nobility for forty years until he killed an Egyptian taskmaster who was beating an Israelite. Moses fled Egypt shortly thereafter out of fear of retribution.</li>
                <li>Moses fled to Midian and ended up becoming a shepherd for a man named Jethro. He married Jethro's daughter, Zipporah.</li>
                <li>After forty years, Moses encountered God in a burning bush. God commanded him to return to Egypt to free the Israelites, God's people, and after Moses complained of being bad with words, also sent Moses's brother Aaron to speak.</li>
                <li>Moses asked Pharoah to free Israel, but Pharoah refused. God worked many, increasingly severe, signs upon Egypt and its gods, and Pharoah finally freed the people after God killed all of Egypt's firstborn (an event that became the Passover). Even then, Pharoah regretted his decision and gave chase, but was thwarted by God at the Red Sea.</li>
                <li>Moses brought Israel God's commandments and plans for the priesthood and led Israel to Canaan, the promised land. Unfortunately, the disbelief of the generation brought God's punishment upon them: they'd not enter the promised land but wander the desert until the current generation died off.</li>
                <li>Moses led Israel for forty more years during their wanderings, but he didn't make it to Canaan; his own disbelief got him barred from entry. Instead, he chose a new leader, Joshua, blessed Israel, and died at the age of 120 after God showed him the promised land.</li>

            <p>"Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. â€¦ And there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face, in all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, and in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel."</p>
